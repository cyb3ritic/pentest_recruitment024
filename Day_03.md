## <center>**Chapter 3: Vulnerability Hunting 🕵️**</center>


#### **Introduction to Common Vulnerabilities 🔓**
- **SQL Injection:** A code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application’s database layer. Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to access or modify data.
  - **Example:** Inputting `1 OR 1=1` in a login form’s username field could bypass authentication if the application is vulnerable.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attack where malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. These scripts are executed in the user's browser.
  - **Types:** Stored XSS (persistent) and Reflected XSS (non-persistent).
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attack that tricks a user into performing actions they did not intend to perform, often by exploiting authenticated sessions.

#### **Basics of Exploitation 💣**
- **Exploitation Process:**
  - **Reconnaissance:** Gather information about the target.
  - **Vulnerability Scanning:** Identify weaknesses in the system.
  - **Exploitation:** Use an exploit to take advantage of a vulnerability.
  - **Post-Exploitation:** Maintain access, escalate privileges, and cover tracks.
- **Metasploit Framework:** A widely used tool for developing and executing exploits. It simplifies the exploitation process with pre-built modules.
  - **Example Command:** `msfconsole` to start Metasploit, followed by `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` to exploit the EternalBlue vulnerability.


#### **Target Practice: Vulnerable Web Applications 🎯**
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application):** A PHP/MySQL web application that’s intentionally vulnerable, making it a safe playground to practice attacks.
- **OWASP Juice Shop:** A modern web application with a range of vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10. It offers a fun, gamified learning experience.

#### **Hack the Planet: SQL Injection & XSS 🕹️**
- **SQL Injection:**
  - Identify vulnerable input fields and craft SQL queries to extract sensitive data.
  - Use tools like SQLmap to automate the process.
  - **Example:** `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vulnerable.php?id=1" --dbs` to list databases.
- **XSS:**
  - Inject scripts into vulnerable web pages to see how they execute in the browser.
  - **Example Payload:** `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` to test for XSS vulnerabilities.
  - Understand how XSS can be used to steal session cookies or redirect users.

**Pro Tip:** Vulnerabilities are like Easter eggs—find them, and you’re on your way to mastering the game! 🥚
