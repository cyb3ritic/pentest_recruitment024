# Hey There, Future Hackers!

Welcome to the dark side... just kidding, but seriously, welcome to **bi0sblr’s pentest recruitment!** If you’ve found your way here, you’re probably ready to take your first steps into the thrilling world of ethical hacking. But be warned, this isn’t just a game—it's a full-on hacking adventure. So grab your keyboards, fire up your terminal, and let’s get cracking!

## The Recruitment Hackathon

We’ve cooked up a two-phase recruitment process that’ll test your skills, determination, and love for all things cyber. Think of it as your initiation into the hacker underworld—minus the black hoodies (unless you’re into that).

### Phase 1: The Bootloader

- **Objective:** This phase is your boot-up sequence. It’s all about the basics—simple, all-round tasks that will get you warmed up and ready for the real action.
- **Tasks:** You’ll be tasked with some foundational challenges—think baby’s first buffer overflow, or recon on easy-mode.
- **Reporting:** Keep us in the loop with regular updates, or you might face a *hard reboot* (read: disqualification). We want to see those pings coming in regularly!

### Phase 2: The Exploit

- **Objective:** Congrats, you’ve survived Phase 1! Now it’s time to dive deeper into the matrix. Phase 2 is where you’ll get to flex those hacker muscles with more specific challenges. We’re talking about solving easy machines, cracking codes, and showing us you’ve got the 0day mindset.
- **Tasks:** The challenges here will separate the script kiddies from the real deal. You’ll need to demonstrate your ability to think like an adversary, dig into vulnerabilities, and patch things up—ethically, of course.
- **Assessment:** Your performance here will be your ticket to joining our ranks. The stronger your hacks, the better your chances.

## What We’re Phishing For

- **Curiosity and Passion:** If you’re the type who sees a lock and immediately wants to pick it (metaphorically speaking), you’re our kind of hacker.
- **Consistency and Commitment:** Stay on target, keep your logs clean, and don’t drop packets. Regular reporting is your best defense against disqualification.
- **Skillz That Killz:** Show us you can pop a shell, pivot like a pro, and do it all with a smile (or at least a smirk).

In a nutshell, our recruitment process is all about proving you’ve got the chops to be part of **bi0sblr’s pentest team.** Nail both phases, and you’ll be one of us—ready to defend the digital world with code, creativity, and a touch of chaos.

Good luck, and remember: **Hack the planet (ethically)!**
